					The April 2015 Nepal earthquake (also known as the Gorkha earthquake) killed nearly 9,000 people and injured nearly 22,000. It occurred at 11:56 Nepal Standard Time on 25 April, with a magnitude of 7.8Mw or 8.1Ms[9] and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of IX (Violent). Its epicenter was east of Gorkha District at Barpak, Gorkha, and its hypocenter was at a depth of approximately 8.2 km (5.1 mi). It was the worst natural disaster to strike Nepal since the 1934 Nepal–Bihar earthquake. The ground motion recorded in Kathmandu valley was of low frequency which, along with its occurrence at an hour where many people in rural areas were working outdoors, decreased the loss of property and human life.

				<h3 style="text-align:center;">Things to do before, during and after earthquake</h3>
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h3 style="text-align: center;">Before Earthquake</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Make sure you have a fire extinguisher, first aid kit, a battery-powered radio, a flashlight, and extra batteries at home.</li>
							<li>Learn first aid.</li>
							<li>Learn how to turn off the gas, water, and electricity.</li>
							<li>Make up a plan of where to meet your family after an earthquake.</li>
							<li>Don't leave heavy objects on shelves (they'll fall during a quake).</li>
							<li>Anchor heavy furniture, cupboards, and appliances to the walls or floor.</li>
							<li>Learn the earthquake plan at your school or workplace.</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h3 style="text-align: center;">During Earthquake</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Stay calm! If you're indoors, stay inside. If you're outside, stay outside.</li>
							<li>If you're indoors, stand against a wall near the center of the building, stand in a doorway, or crawl under heavy furniture (a desk or table). Stay away from windows and outside doors.</li>
							<li>If you're outdoors, stay in the open away from power lines or anything that might fall. Stay away from buildings (stuff might fall off the building or the building could fall on you).</li>
							<li>Don't use matches, candles, or any flame. Broken gas lines and fire don't mix.</li>
							<li>If you're in a car, stop the car and stay inside the car until the earthquake stops.</li>
							<li>Don't use elevators (they'll probably get stuck anyway).</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h3 style="text-align: center;">After Earthquake</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Check yourself and others for injuries. Provide first aid for anyone who needs it.</li>
							<li>Check water, gas, and electric lines for damage. If any are damaged, shut off the valves. Check for the smell of gas. If you smell it, open all the windows and doors, leave immediately, and report it to the authorities (use someone else's phone).</li>
							<li>Turn on the radio. Don't use the phone unless it's an emergency.</li>
							<li>Stay out of damaged buildings.</li>
							<li>If you're at school or work, follow the emergency plan or the instructions of the person in charge.</li>
							<li>Expect aftershocks.</li>
